🧠 CORE LANGUAGES (FOUNDATION)

Learn first — deeply

Python → backend, AI/ML, automation

JavaScript → frontend + backend logic

👉 These two power everything else.

🎨 FRONTEND (USER INTERFACE)

Learn after JS basics

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (Advanced)

React (single framework is enough)

No Angular. No Vue. React dominates hiring.

⚙️ BACKEND (APIs & BUSINESS LOGIC)

Cloud-native, scalable

Flask (primary backend)

FastAPI (upgrade after Flask)

Node.js + Express (secondary backend)

Flask teaches architecture. FastAPI gives speed & scale.

🗄️ DATABASES (DATA LAYER)
Relational (MANDATORY)

PostgreSQL (primary)

MySQL (secondary – optional)

NoSQL (ONLY ONE)

MongoDB

Postgres + MongoDB covers 90% of industry use cases.

🔐 SECURITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Learn inside projects, not separately.

Authentication (JWT)

Authorization (RBAC)

Password hashing

Environment variables

Basic OWASP Top 10

🧪 TESTING & QUALITY

Learn gradually.

Unit testing (backend)

API testing

Basic frontend tests

Linting & formatting

☁️ CLOUD & DEVOPS (HIGH INCOME LAYER)

Linux fundamentals

Git & GitHub (advanced workflows)

Docker

CI/CD

AWS or GCP (choose ONE later)

Nginx

Deployment & monitoring

🤖 AI / ML (VALUE MULTIPLIER)

NumPy

Pandas

ML basics

Model inference APIs

LLM integration (OpenAI / similar)

AI as microservice

AI is integrated, not standalone.

🧩 ARCHITECTURE & SYSTEM THINKING

This is what makes you senior-level.

Requirement analysis

System design

API design

Monolith → microservices

Scalability

Fault tolerance

Performance tuning

Clear documentation
